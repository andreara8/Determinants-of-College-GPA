# Determinants-of-College-GPA
This is the first of a series of three projects completed for my Applied Econometrics course of UCLA's Master of Quantitative Economics. The objective is to identify the best predictor of students' GPA in college. To achieve this, we test multiple SLR models with the appropriate variables transformations and robustness checks.
